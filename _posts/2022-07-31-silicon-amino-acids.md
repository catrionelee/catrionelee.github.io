Today, a paper was published entitled, "[Silicon Analogs of L-Amino Acids: Properties of Building Blocks of an Alien Biosphere](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S0006350922020117)," which is very exciting. Silicon is in the same group as carbon so it has the same number of valence electrons. This means, chemically, it behaves similarly though not exactly as carbon (what Earth's major biomolecules are made of). The paper used "PM3/PM7 semi-empirical quantum-chemical methods" to calculate all of the theoretical chemical properties of an L-amino acid with silicon.

The authors concluded that there are many differences between a carbon- and silicon-based amino acids. They go on to summarize each of the differences, but one that caught my eye was the weaker Ï€ bonding in aromatic side chains due to having longer Si-Si bonds than C-C. I would speculate that this would also translate to nucleic acids, being weaker and more easy to separate.

There probably isn't a definitive answer that life would never use this element, but if it did, it would look and function very differently.

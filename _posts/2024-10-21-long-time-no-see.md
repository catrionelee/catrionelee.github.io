Welcome back: to myself! During the chunk of my MSc, I took a break from updating this website. But now, starting a new degree I am back at it.

## What happened from 2022-2024?

I successfully defended my MSc thesis from the University of Lethbridge in December 2023. That was a big accomplishment for me. Up until that point, I was buried deep in my research, teaching, and writing responsibilities. I even attempted to dip my toes into freelancing, but decided that my focus needed to be on my degree. The effort required to be successful would have taken too much away from my research.

## What am I doing now?

Now, I am a PhD student at the University of Manitoba, studying whale hemoglobin evolution. A huge shift from my microbiological/agricultural background. But it's exciting new opportunity in a new city that I'm ready to sink my teeth into.

## What's next?

I plan on working on this webpage as a tool to help keep my PhD program accountable to myself. I'll be sharing *Papers of the Week* (POW) on relevant literature to what I'm currently working on. The "of the week" portion might be a stretch, but I plan to aim for a minimum of 3 per month. Those posts will be in a specific section of the website, so if you just want though experiments or sci comm posts, those will be in a separate.

That's all for now. I need to be working on my first POW ...

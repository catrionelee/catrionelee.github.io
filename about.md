I am an aspiring microbiologist that dabbles in bioinformatics, so an all around lover of microbes. I use they/them/she/her pronouns.

I am a Ph.D. student sudying the evolution of hemoglobins in whales, dolphins, and porpoises. I am leveraging the availablility of global genomics data to accomplish the goals of resurrecting ansectral whale hemoglobins as well as determine if certain hemoglobin variants might predict different life styles.

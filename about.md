I am an aspiring microbiologist that dabbles in bioinformatics, so an all around lover of microbes. I use she/they pronouns.

I am a Master's of Science candidate studying at the University of Lethbridge in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry under the co-supervision of Drs. Tim McAllister and Athanasios Zovoilis. My research is conducted through the Lethbridge Research and Development Centre of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (Government of Canada) in the areas of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and metagenomics.
